apartment with large windows, reaching to the ground. On the walls
are old masters whose darkness conceals their artistic
insignificance. The furniture is fine and solid. Nothing is very
new or smart. The chintzes have a rather pallid Victorian air. The
room with its substantial magnificence represents the character of
a family rather than the taste of an individual.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>It is night and one or two electric lamps are burning.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Moore</span>, <i>an elderly impressive butler, comes in, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Gann</span>.
<i>This is</i> <span class="smcap">Claude Insoley’s</span> <i>gamekeeper, a short, sturdy man,
grizzled, with wild stubborn hair and a fringe of beard round his
chin. He wears his Sunday clothes of sombre broadcloth.</i></p></div>

<p>I’ll wait.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Moore.</span></p>

you at this time of night?</p>

peaches.</p>

<p>I suppose you know what I’ve sent for you about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>No, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I should have thought you might guess without<a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a> hurting yourself. The
Rector tells me that your daughter Peggy came back last night.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Bit thick, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what you mean, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that’s all rot, Gann. You know perfectly well what I mean. It’s a
beastly matter for both of us, but it’s no good funking it.... You’ve
been on the estate pretty well all your life, haven’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>It’s fifty-four years come next Michaelmas that my father was took on,
and I was earning wages here before you was born.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>My governor always said you were the best keeper he ever struck, and
hang it all, I haven’t had anything to complain about either.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>Thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Anyhow, we shan’t make it any better by beating about the bush. It
appears that Peggy has got into<a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a> trouble in London.... I’m awfully sorry
for you, and all that sort of thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>Poor child. She’s not to blame.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Claude</span> <i>gives a slight shrug of the shoulders</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>I want ’er to forget all she’s gone through. It was a mistake she ever
went to London, but she would go. Now I’ll keep ’er beside me. She’ll
never leave me again till I’m put underground.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>That’s all very fine and large, but I’m afraid Peggy can’t stay on here,
Gann.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>You know the rule of the estate as well as I do. When a girl gets into a
mess she has to go.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>It’s a wicked rule!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>You never thought so before, and this isn’t the first time you’ve seen
it applied, by a long chalk.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>The girl went away once and come to grief. She<a name="page_6" id="page_6"></a> wellnigh killed herself
with the shame of it. I’m not going to let ’er out of my sight again.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid I can’t make an exception in your favour, Gann.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Desperately.</i>] Where’s she to go to?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I expect she’ll be able to get a job somewhere. Mrs. Insoley’ll do
all she can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>It’s no good, Squire. I can’t let ’er go. I want ’er.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I don’t want to be unreasonable. I’ll give you a certain amount of time
to make arrangements.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>Time’s no good to me. I haven’t the ’eart to send her away.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid it’s not a question of whether you like it or not. You must
do as you’re told.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>I can’t part with her, and there’s an end of it.<a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a></p>

<p>You’d better go and talk it over with your wife.</p>

<p>If Peggy isn’t gone by that time, I am afraid I shall have to send you
away.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>You wouldn’t do that, sir? You couldn’t do it, Squire, not after all
these years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>We’ll soon see about that, my friend.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>You can’t dismiss me for that. I’ll have the law of you. I’ll sue you
for wrongful dismissal.<a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>You can do what you damned well like; but if Peggy hasn’t gone by

<p>Not if you saw it for three meals a day for ten years? Oh, my dear, you
don’t know what that view is like at an early breakfast on a winter’s
morning. You sit there looking at it, with icy fingers, wondering if
your nose is red, while your husband reads morning prayers, because his
father read morning prayers before him; and the sky looks as if it were
going to sink down and crush you.</p>

everything that a woman can want to make her happy. I’ve got a husband

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>You’ve got everything that I haven’t got. D’you suppose I’ve lived ten
years in my husband’s family without realising the gulf that separates
Miss Vernon of Foley from the very middle-class young woman that Claude
Insoley was such a damned fool as<a name="page_20" id="page_20"></a> to marry? You’ve got money and I
haven’t a farthing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don’t talk such nonsense! How would you like to be dependent on
somebody else for every penny you had? If I want to get Claude a
Christmas present I have to buy it out of his money.... It wouldn’t be
so maddening if I only had forty pounds a year of my own, but I haven’t
a penny, not a penny! And I have to keep accounts. After all, it’s his
money. If he wants accounts why shouldn’t he have them? I have to write
down the cost of every packet of hair-pins. [<i>With a sudden chuckle.</i>]
And the worst of it is, I never could add.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>That, of course, must increase the difficulty of keeping accounts.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been an utter failure from the beginning. They despised me because
I was a nobody and not even a rich nobody; but I was a strapping,
healthy sort of young woman and they consoled themselves by thinking I’d
have children&mdash;a milch cow was what they wanted&mdash;and I haven’t even had
children....</p>

<p>So I imagined by the fact that I found no conveyance at the station. I
had to take a fly, and it cost me four-and-sixpence.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>But why didn’t you let us know you’d changed your plans, mother?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I did let you know. I wrote to Grace yesterday. She must have got my
letter this morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, how stupid of me! I recognised your writing, and as it was my
birthday I thought I wouldn’t open it till to-morrow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Grace!<a name="page_30" id="page_30"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’m dreadfully sorry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>It was only by the mercy of Providence that I didn’t have to walk.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>There are always flies at the station.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Providence might very well have caused them to be all engaged.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know why you should think Providence has nothing better to do
than to play practical jokes on us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking round.</i>] And may I inquire why you have turned the house in
which your father died into a bear garden?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>It’s Grace’s birthday, and we thought there would be no harm in our
having a little fun.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Putting up her face-à-main and staring at the company.</i>] I’m
old-fashioned enough and well-bred enough to like people to be
introduced to me.<a name="page_31" id="page_31"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Nowadays every one’s so disreputable that we think it safer not to make
introductions.... This is Miss Lewis.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Edith.</span></p>

<p>How d’you do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Lewis!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little smile of amusement.</i>] I think you know Miss Vernon of
Foley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very affably.</i>] Of course I know Miss Vernon of Foley. My dear Helen,
you’re looking very handsome. It wants a woman of birth to wear the
outrageous costumes of the present day.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking hands with her.</i>] It’s so nice of you to say so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I forget if you know Mr. Cobbett.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He bows slightly as</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley</span> <i>looks at him through her

<p>Cobbett!<a name="page_32" id="page_32"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Hall</span>.] We used to have a milkman called Cobbett,
Louisa.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Hall.</span></p>

<p>Our milkman is called Wilkinson now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very graciously.</i>] You were singing a song when I came in. What was it
called?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather sulkily.</i>] “I can’t reach that top note.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I wondered why you were trying.... Why are you hiding behind that sofa,
Archibald? Do you not intend to kiss your mother?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I’m delighted to see you, my dear mother.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He kisses her on the forehead.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

night.<a name="page_33" id="page_33"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I find two sermons a day excellent for the appetite. And the Bible tells
us that corn makes the young men cheerful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Aren’t you dreadfully hungry? Wouldn’t you like something
to eat?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>No, I shall go straight to my room. It always upsets me to drive in a
hired carriage.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’ll just go and see that everything’s nice and comfortable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p><a name="page_34" id="page_34"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Claude, will you take Miss Hall into the dining-room and give her a

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Hall.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think I want anything, thank you, Mrs. Insoley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense, Louisa! Allow me to know what is good for you. You’ll see that
she drinks the port, Claude. [<i>As they go out.</i>] I want to talk to
Archibald.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>My dear mother, I throw myself at your feet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] I very much doubt if you could. You’re growing much
too fat. It’s quite time they made you something.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] The landed gentry hasn’t its old power. Promotion in the
Church nowadays is given with new-fangled ideas about merit and
scholarship and heaven knows what.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I hope you never eat potatoes or bread?<a name="page_35" id="page_35"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I fly from them as I would from temptation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Nor soup?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>It is as the scarlet woman to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>And I trust you never touch green peas.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Ah, there you have me. Even the saints had their weaknesses. I confess
that when green peas are in season I always put on flesh.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>You want some one to keep a firm hand on you. You must marry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I saw you approaching that topic by leaps and bounds, mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>It’s a clergyman’s duty to marry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Chaffing her.</i>] St. Paul says....<a name="page_36" id="page_36"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] I know what St. Paul’s views were, Archibald, and I
disagree with them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Dryly.</i>] I have every reason to believe he was of excellent family,
mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Giving him a quick look.</i>] We all know that it was a great
disappointment to Helen Vernon when&mdash;you know what I mean.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I can’t help thinking she showed bad taste in surviving the blow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>It was a great disappointment to me. I had set my heart on joining Foley
to Kenyon-Fulton.... It wouldn’t be too late even now if you had the
sense to appreciate Helen Vernon’s affection for you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>My dear mother, I can’t persuade myself for a moment that Helen Vernon
has any affection for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>A woman of her age is prepared to have affection for any one who asks
her to marry him.<a name="page_37" id="page_37"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Even if he’s a poor country parson?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>You’re a great deal more than a country parson, Archibald. It is
unlikely that Grace will have any children, so unless&mdash;something happens
to allow Claude to marry again....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean by that, mother?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Grace is not immortal.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, she has excellent health.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>There may be other ways of disposing of her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>What ways?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at him calmly.</i>] Since when have you laboured under the

<p>In that case I shall go to my room. Archibald, tell Louisa that I am

<p>Who is the young lady you have staying with you, Grace?</p>

<p>Edith Lewis. She’s a friend of mine.</p>

<p>I don’t know that there’s any other way of describing them.</p>

empty! Empty! I know now that it wasn’t love I felt for you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>It’s rather late in the day to have found that out, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bitterly.</i>] Yes, that’s just it. It’s late in the day for
everything.... Here they are.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Scene</span> <i>is the same as in the preceding Act. It is evening,

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I ought to have been told before. It was wicked to keep it from me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peggy.</span></p>

<p>I thought you knew, mum. I wasn’t to know that you ’adn’t been told
anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a friendly smile.</i>] I’m not blaming you, Peggy.... Mr. Insoley’s
out now, but I’ll talk to<a name="page_48" id="page_48"></a> him as soon as she come in. You’d better go
home and fetch your father.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peggy.</span></p>

<p>You know what father is, mum. I’m afraid he won’t come.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but I think it’s very important. Tell him that....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Passing her hand wearily across her forehead.</i>] No. I’ve just
finished.... Try and get your father to come, Peggy.</p>

<p>What’s the matter? You seem rather put out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>That’s the daughter of one of the keepers. She came to me just now and
asked me to beg Claude to<a name="page_49" id="page_49"></a> give them a little more time. I hadn’t an
idea what she meant. Then she said Claude had told her father he must
send her away within twenty-four hours or lose his place.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Flippantly.</i>] Oh, yes, I know. She seems to be rather a flighty young
person. Claude and your brother-in-law were talking about it after lunch
in the smoking-room.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Why didn’t you tell me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Well, it never struck me you didn’t know. Besides&mdash;you haven’t shown any
great desire for my society the last day or two.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a quick look at him.</i>] I’ve had other guests to attend to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shrugging his shoulders.</i>] And it seemed rather a sordid little story.
I don’t think I can interest myself very much at this time of day in the
gamekeeper’s daughter who kicks over the traces.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sarcastically.</i>] It’s so devilish mid-Victorian, isn’t it?<a name="page_50" id="page_50"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Surprised at her tone.</i>] It’s not really bothering you, is it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sudden vehement outburst.</i>] Don’t you see that wretched girl
has done no more than I have?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] Great Scott, you haven’t produced an unexpected
baby, have you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don’t, don’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coolly.</i>] In point of fact she’s done a great deal more than you have.
She’s been found out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>How can you be so odiously cynical?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>I notice people always call you odiously cynical when you talk plain
horse-sense to them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Can’t you realise what I’m feeling? She had excuses. She was alone, and
little more than a child; she had no education. How could she be
expected to resist temptation?<a name="page_51" id="page_51"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>It’s an absolute delusion that the lower classes are less able to resist
temptation than their betters. In the first place, they have a much more
systematic moral education, and then they’re taught from early youth to
look upon virtue as a valuable asset.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going up to him suddenly.</i>] Harry, would you mind very much if I
stopped the whole thing?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Of course I should mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, don’t say that because it’s the conventional thing to say. I
want you to be frank with me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Uneasily.</i>] Why do you ask me now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a look at him, a little unwillingly.</i>] I feel so horribly mean.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Claude?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sort of appeal, as if she were excusing herself.</i>] He’s so
awfully good to me, Harry. Every present he gives me, every kind word is
like a stab in my<a name="page_52" id="page_52"></a> heart. I’m beastly to him sometimes, I can’t help it,
but nothing seems to make any difference to him.... Whatever I do, he
loves me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Are you beginning to care for Claude&mdash;differently?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, it’s no use pretending. I never loved him as he loved me. I
couldn’t. I was bored by his love. Yes, all the time we’ve been
married.... It’s only lately....</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She pauses abruptly.</i> <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span> <i>gives her a sidelong glance</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what I feel or what to do. I’m so bewildered and
wretched.... He bores me still&mdash;oh, horribly sometimes. And yet at
moments I feel as though I were a good deal more than half in love with
him. It’s too absurd. With Claude&mdash;after all these years. Something has
changed me.... It’s the last thing that ought to have changed me towards
him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She flushes hotly, and again</i> <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span> <i>looks at her, and a rather
sulky expression comes into his face</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>It’s not a very pleasant position for me, is it?<a name="page_53" id="page_53"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn’t have thought it ever had been a very pleasant position
considering what a good friend Claude has been to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>If you look at it in that way, I dare say it would be better to put an
end to the whole thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>You have been rather a blackguard, haven’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>No. I don’t pretend to be better than anybody else, but I’m quite
certain I’m no worse. I’m a perfectly normal man in good health. It’s
idiotic to abuse me because I’ve done what any other fellow would have
done in my place.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Suddenly understanding.</i>] Is that all it was to you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Wasn’t I anything to you at all? Only a more or less attractive woman
who happened to cross your path? If I was only that, why couldn’t you
leave me alone? What harm did I ever do you? Oh, it was cruel of you.
Cruel!<a name="page_54" id="page_54"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quietly.</i>] No man’s able to have an affair all by himself, you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean by that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Well, most fellows are very shy, and they’re dreadfully frightened of a
rebuff. A man doesn’t take much risk until&mdash;well, until he finds there’s
not much risk to take.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>D’you mean to say I gave you to understand.... Oh, how can you humiliate
me like that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Isn’t there a certain amount of truth in it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking as it were into her own soul.</i>] Yes.... Oh, I’m so ashamed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>The world would be a jolly sight easier place to live in if people
weren’t such humbugs.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hardly able to believe the truth that presents itself to her, yet
eager to probe it.</i>] D’you think it was only<a name="page_55" id="page_55"></a> curiosity on my side and
nothing more than opportunity on yours?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>That’s the foundation of nine love affairs out of ten, you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Trying to justify herself in her own eyes.</i>] I was so bored&mdash;so
lonely. I never felt at home with the people I had to live with. They
humiliated me. And you seemed the same sort of person as I was. I felt
at my ease with you. At first I thought you cared for the things I cared
for&mdash;music and books and pictures: it took me quite a time to discover
that you didn’t know the difference between a fiddle and a jews’
harp.... I wonder why you troubled to take me in.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>I naturally talked about what I thought would please you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I remember at first I felt as if I were just stepping out of a prison
into the fresh air. It seemed to me as if&mdash;oh, I don’t know how to put
it&mdash;as if spring flowers were suddenly blossoming in my heart.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid you were asking more from me than I was able to give you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I don’t blame you. You’re quite right: it’s I<a name="page_56" id="page_56"></a> who am to blame.
[<i>With sudden vehemence.</i>] Oh, how I envy that wretched girl! If she
fell it was because she loved. I asked her who the man was, and she
wouldn’t tell me. She said she didn’t want to get him into trouble. She
must love him still.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Moved by the pain which he sees she is suffering.</i>] I hope you don’t
think me an awful skunk, Grace. I’m sorry we’ve made such a hash of
things.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going on with her own thoughts.</i>] It would be horrible if that
wretched girl were punished while I go scot-free. I can’t let her be
turned away like a leper. I should never rest in peace again.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Claude’s not very fond of going back on his word. He seems to have
delivered an ultimatum, and I expect he’ll stick to it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>It means so much to me. I feel somehow that if I can only save that poor
child it’ll make up in a way&mdash;oh, very little&mdash;for all the harm I’ve
done.... D’you think I’m perfectly absurd?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Life seems devilish complicated sometimes, doesn’t it?<a name="page_57" id="page_57"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] Devilish.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>The sound is heard of a carriage stopping outside.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Hulloa, what’s that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>It’s my mother-in-law. She’s been out for her drive. [<i>With a glance at
her watch.</i>] Claude ought to be in soon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>What are you going to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’m going to use every means in my power to persuade him to change his
mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>You’re not going to do anything foolish, Grace?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>How d’you mean? [<i>His meaning suddenly strikes her.</i>] You don’t think I
might have to.... Oh, that would be too much to ask me.... D’you think I
might have to tell him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Whatever you do, Grace, I want you to know that<a name="page_58" id="page_58"></a> if anything happens I’m
willing to do the straight thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking her head.</i>] No, I should never ask you to marry me. Now we
both know how things are between us&mdash;how they’ve always been....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>I’m awfully sorry, Grace.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>There’s no need to be. I’m glad to know the truth. There was nothing
that held us together before but my cowardice. I was so afraid of going
back to that dreary loneliness. But you’ve given me courage.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Is there nothing left of it at all?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>So far as I’m concerned nothing at all&mdash;but shame.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Edith Lewis</span> <i>comes in</i>. <span class="smcap">Grace</span>, <i>recovering herself quickly, throws

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Edith.</span></p>

<p>We’ve had such a lovely drive.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>And d’you think the country’s as beautiful as ever?<a name="page_59" id="page_59"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Edith.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gaily.</i>] Oh, I didn’t look at the country. I was much too excited.
Mrs. Insoley has been telling me the dreadful pasts of all the families
in the neighbourhood. It appears the further they go back the more
shocking their behaviour has been.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>I notice that even the grossest immorality becomes respectable when it’s
a hundred years old.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ironically.</i>] It’s very hard, isn’t it? Mrs. Grundy has no mercy.
She’ll take even you to her bosom before you know where you are.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Vernon</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Hall</span>.

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed your drive.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t go for my enjoyment, Grace; I went to exercise the horses.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Meanwhile, I hear you took the opportunity of enlarging
Edith’s young mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Edith</span>.] When you come to Foley you must<a name="page_60" id="page_60"></a> remind me to show you the
portraits of my great-grandmother, Mary Vernon. She had a tremendous
affair with the Regent, you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pleasantly.</i>] My dear Helen, I have the greatest affection for you,
but I cannot allow a statement like that to go unchallenged. There is no
evidence whatever of the truth of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know how you can say that, Mrs. Insoley, considering that I have
all my great-grandmother’s letters to the Regent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] Where are his letters to your great-grandmother?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>She gave them back at the time he returned hers, naturally.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I can see her. If she had any letters she would have kept them. Any
woman would.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bridling a little.</i>] I can’t imagine why you should suddenly throw
doubts on a story that the whole county has believed for a hundred
years. Every one knew all about Mary Vernon.<a name="page_61" id="page_61"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Chaffing her.</i>] I am aware that your great-grandmother was an
abandoned hussy, but that in itself is no proof that she ever had
anything to do with the Regent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>You can’t deny that he slept at Foley, Mrs. Insoley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Only one night.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>It’s notorious that at that very time he was on terms of the greatest
intimacy with Pamela Bainbridge. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Edith Lewis</span>.] I am not an
Insoley, thank God; I am a Bainbridge. And whenever he came to this part
of the country he stayed with us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>I know you’ve always flattered yourself that there was something between
them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With complete self-assurance.</i>] And well I may, considering that I
still have a lock of hair which he gave my grandmother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>Half the families in the country have a greasy<a name="page_62" id="page_62"></a> lock of hair which they
tell you was the Regent’s. Personally, I think it’s rather snobbish to
make a claim of that sort unless one’s perfectly sure.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bridling in her turn.</i>] I think you’re extremely rude, Helen. In the
presence of a man I can’t go into details, but I have proof of every
word I say. You know what I mean, Louisa?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Hall.</span></p>

<p>I believed the worst from the beginning, Mrs. Insoley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>I have no doubt you firmly believe what you say, Mrs. Insoley; but if
you don’t mind my saying so, one has only to look at the portrait of
Pamela Bainbridge to know the whole thing’s absurd.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Frigidly.</i>] We won’t argue the point, Helen; I know I’m right, and
there’s an end of it.... Put the dog on that chair, Louisa.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Hall.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>No, but Mr. Cobbett’s been sitting in it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>And may no one use a chair that Mr. Cobbett has been sitting in?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Certainly. But it so happens that Mr. Cobbett is just going to sit in it
again.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a grim smile.</i>] Mr. Cobbett has legs.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Only two, and if a merciful Providence had intended him to stand on them
it would undoubtedly have provided him with four.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett seems to be better acquainted with the designs of Providence
than I should have expected.... Louisa, give me the dog. He shall sit on
my lap.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Chaffing her.</i>] Ah, if you’d only told me that was the alternative, of
course I wouldn’t have hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I think you are very vulgar, sir.... I’m surprised that you should laugh
at such an inane joke, Grace.<a name="page_64" id="page_64"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>You forget that I have a naturally vulgar nature.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I try to, but you take great pains to remind me.</p>

<p>Well, did you enjoy your drive, mother?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t go for my enjoyment, Claude; I went to exercise the horses.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>We’ve been to a parish meeting.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather peevishly.</i>] It’s getting almost impossible to do anything for
these Somersetshire people. They’re such an obstinate, pig-headed lot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I prophesied it forty years ago. When they first introduced all this
nonsense about education, I said it was a serious matter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a twinkle in his eye.</i>] Like all good prophets you apparently
took care to be rather vague about it, mother.<a name="page_65" id="page_65"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Considering you weren’t born I don’t see what you can know about it,
Archibald. I said this would happen. I said they would make the lower
classes so independent that no one would be able to do anything with
them. I went for a walk in the village this morning and nobody took any
notice of me. Isn’t that so, Louisa?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Hall.</span></p>

<p>No, Mrs. Insoley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean by no, Louisa?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Hall.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hastily.</i>] I beg your pardon. I mean yes, Mrs. Insoley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>A few old men touched their hats, and one old woman curtsied, but that
was all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little nod.</i>] Of course it’s not important in itself, but it’s
the sign of a change. The long and short of it is that they don’t look
up to their betters as they used to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ironically.</i>] Perhaps they’ve ceased to realise that we are their
betters.<a name="page_66" id="page_66"></a></p>

<p>[<i>Abruptly.</i>] Peggy Gann came to see me this afternoon, Claude.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Did she?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a very short pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span> <i>sees what is going to

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Edith Lewis</span>.] Wouldn’t you like to come for a stroll in the
garden?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Edith Lewis.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’ve asked her to fetch her father.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Cobbett</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Edith Lewis</span> <i>go out</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Without waiting for the movement.</i>] I’m sorry you did that, Grace.
I’ve got nothing to say to him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley</span>.] Do you know that Claude has threatened to dismiss
Gann if Peggy hasn’t gone by ten o’clock to-night?<a name="page_67" id="page_67"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>For once in his life Claude has acted with spirit. He gave Gann
twenty-four hours to think it over. My father would have given him
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Why was it all kept from me? It seems that everybody knew but me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Hang it all, Grace, I wanted to tell you last night and you wouldn’t let
me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Startled.</i>] Oh! Was it that? I didn’t know.... Claude, I want you to
be very kind and forgive that wretched girl. I want you to tell Gann
that she needn’t go.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quite firmly.</i>] My dear, I can’t do that. I’ve made up my mind and I
must stick to it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Hang it all, what would happen to the discipline of the estate if I were
always shilly-shallying? Every one in the place knows that when I say a
thing I mean it. It’s an enormous advantage to all concerned.<a name="page_68" id="page_68"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a coaxing smile.</i>] It wouldn’t do any harm if you made an
exception just this once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>It’s a matter of upholding my authority. Gann refused to do what I told
him, and I had to threaten him with immediate dismissal. I couldn’t eat
my words now without looking a perfect fool.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you think it’s awfully unjust to send a girl away because she’s
got into trouble?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>It’s a rule of the estate. I didn’t make it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Vernon</span>.] Helen, you’re a woman. You must see how
cruel it is. Can’t <i>you</i> say something to help me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what else one’s to do. After all, we have the same rule at
Foley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>They have it on half the large estates in the kingdom. It’s absolutely
essential if one has any regard for decency.<a name="page_69" id="page_69"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>I don’t suppose it would be so common, and it certainly wouldn’t have
lasted so long, if there hadn’t been some good in it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Violently.</i>] Oh, it’s maddening. Always, always, there’s that stone
wall in front of me. Whatever is, is good. However cruel and unjust a
custom is, no one must touch it because it’s a custom. If a law is
infamous, does it become any less infamous because people have suffered
from it for a dozen generations?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps you’re not very competent to judge matters of this sort, my
dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid your sympathy is rather wasted in this particular case. Peggy
Gann isn’t a very deserving young woman.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>If she were, there’d be no need for me to plead for her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>On those lines the more of a hussy a girl is the more she’s deserving of
sympathy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Archibald</span>.] You had nothing against her till this happened.<a name="page_70" id="page_70"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Nothing very definite. She was always rather cheeky, and she never came
to Sunday-school very regularly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Is that all?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>My own belief is that the Ganns are really Dissenters.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Good heavens, they positively revel in going to church.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>That may be or it may not. But they give <i>me</i> the impression of chapel
people.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Heaven knows, I don’t want to seem hard and unsympathetic, but after
all, you’re not going to keep people moral if you pamper those who
aren’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>And what d’you think’ll happen to her if you make her leave here?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>We’ll do our best for her. It’s not a pleasant position for any of us,
Grace. I’ve been wretched about the whole thing, and I’m sure Claude has
too.<a name="page_71" id="page_71"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Of course I have. But hang it all, in our position we can’t afford to
think of sentiment. Especially now that they’re attacking us all round
we’ve got to show them that we can keep a firm hand on the reins.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Do us the justice to see that we’re really trying to do what’s right. It
may be very wrong that we should be in our particular positions, and we
may be quite unworthy of them. But we didn’t make society, and we’re not
responsible for its inequalities. We find ourselves in a certain
station, and we have to act accordingly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>The long and the short of it is that it’s our duty to look after those
whom Providence has placed in our charge. And it’s our duty to punish as
well as to reward.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, how hard you are! One would think you’d never done anything in your
life that you regret. [<i>With increasing violence.</i>] Oh, you virtuous
people, I hate you. You’re never content till you see the sinner
actually frizzling. As if hell were needed when every sin brings its own
punishment! And you never make excuses. You don’t know how many
temptations we resist for the one we fall to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>No. You’ve had no exercise to-day, Louisa. You’d better walk three times

<p>I’m not very well to-day, Mrs. Insoley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Oh, nonsense! You’re in the best of health. And you can take the dog

<p>Good afternoon, Gann.<a name="page_74" id="page_74"></a></p>

<p>Good afternoon, sir. Peggy said you wished to see me, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p><i>I</i> asked her to bring you here, Gann. I thought it would be better if
you spoke to Mr. Insoley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>I’ve got nothing to say to Mr. Insoley, ma’am.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I was hoping to find you in a more reasonable state of mind, Gann. You
know, you can only hurt yourself by being pig-headed and stubborn.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t know as how I was, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span>.] You see, the man doesn’t give me a chance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Making an effort on himself.</i>] Please, Squire, I come to know if I’m
really to go to-morrow? I know you said you’d send me away, Squire. But
I couldn’t bring myself to believe you meant it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I’m willing to listen to anything you’ve got to say. I want to be quite
fair to you.<a name="page_75" id="page_75"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>If I could only make you see as what you ask ain’t possible, I’m sure
you’d let us stay. There’s nowhere Peggy <i>can</i> go to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Hang it all, Mrs. Insoley’ll do all she can for her. You may be quite
sure that Peggy shan’t want for money.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>It isn’t money the girl wants. If I send ’er away she’ll just go to the
bad altogether.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>You see, it’s a matter of principle, Gann. It would be devilish unjust
to make an exception in your favour.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Stepping forward with surly indignation and facing</i> <span class="smcap">Claude</span>.] I love

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>That’s all very fine and large, Gann. But if she’d been a good girl,

<p>I don’t want to rub it in and all that sort of thing, but my own feeling
is that if she came rather a cropper, it was because she was&mdash;if you
don’t mind my saying so&mdash;because she was that way inclined. I don’t
think anyone can accuse me of being a hard man, but I’m afraid I haven’t
much pity for women who....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gann.</span></p>

<p>I couldn’t say it before them. They’d never understand. They’d only
sneer. But can’t you see, Claude, that it’s out of the question to drive
Gann away so callously? He loves the place just as much as you love
it.... In my heart I seem to feel suddenly all that his shabby little
cottage means to him&mdash;the woods and coverts and the meadows and the
trees. His life is bound up with Kenyon. His roots are in the earth as
if he were a growing thing. Can’t you see what it must mean to him to
leave it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>He only goes because he’s headstrong and obstinate. He’s the
Somersetshire peasant all over. You do your best for them and you get no
gratitude. You try to reason with them, but you can’t get a single idea
into their thick heads.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>You can’t punish him because he’s stupid and dull. You’re throwing him
upon the world in his old age. It means starvation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>You must know that I’m only doing it because I think it’s my duty.<a name="page_80" id="page_80"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Oh, men always talk of their duty when they want to be
odiously cruel.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Grace, how can you be so unkind to me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Claude, if you love me at all, give in to me this time. You don’t
know what it means to me. I’ve often been horrible to you, but I’m going
to be different. I want to love you. I want to be more to you than I’ve
ever been. Claude, I implore you to do what I ask you&mdash;just because I
ask it, because you love me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting passionately.</i>] Oh, no, don’t, Claude; for God’s sake be
sincere and natural. Can’t you forget that you’re a landed proprietor

as weak and as&mdash;as frail as the rest of us? You hope to be forgiven
yourself, and you’re utterly pitiless.</p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Oh, how can you make phrases! What on earth have I got
to do with it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Hang it all, don’t you see that it’s because of you that I can’t give
way? It’s beastly having to say it. It makes me feel such an ass.</p>

<p>[<i>Beginning to be frightened.</i>] What have I got to do with it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Until I knew you I don’t suppose I had a higher opinion of women than
most men, but you taught me what a&mdash;what a stunning fine thing a good
woman is.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hoarsely.</i>] It’s perfectly absurd. It’s&mdash;it’s unreasonable. I’ve not
been.... Only the other day you said I was cold. And just now you told
me I was unkind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I dare say that’s all my fault. I expect I bore you sometimes. After
all, I know you’re worth about six of me. I can’t expect you to love me
as I love you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>D’you mean to say that if I weren’t&mdash;what you think me, you wouldn’t

<p>I don’t suppose I should feel quite the same about it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Trying to keep back her sobs.</i>] It’s so unreasonable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Even if it weren’t for the rule of the estate, I couldn’t let her live
in the same place as you. I can’t help it. It’s just a sort of instinct.
It simply disgusts me to think that you may meet that&mdash;that woman when
you walk about, and her kid.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Claude, you don’t know what you’re saying.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>When I heard she’d been here and you’d been talking to her, I felt
almost sick.</p>

windows leading into the garden. On the walls are departed Insoleys

the Victorian era, military-looking fellows in the uniform of the
early nineteenth century, and ungainly Georgian squires with their
wives in powdered hair. Between the windows, standing well away
from the wall, rather far back, is a round table laid out for
breakfast. On the Sheraton sideboard is a cloth, a stand for
keeping dishes warm, a large ham, and plates and forks and spoons.
Against the wall opposite the sideboard are a row of chairs, and
there are half a dozen chairs round the table. There are doors
right and left.</i></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I must say I don’t like to have my paper messed about by a lot of people
before I’ve had a chance of looking at it. Half the pleasure of reading
the <i>Times</i> is reading it first. Besides, the <i>Morning Post</i> and the

<p>When I was mistress of this house breakfast was served punctually at
eight o’clock every morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Flippantly.</i>] It must have seemed just like supper. Did you have it
the last thing before going to bed?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I made no exceptions. The day after my cousin James broke his neck in
the hunting-field and was brought to this very house on a stretcher, I
came down as the clock struck. And a very hearty breakfast I ate too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps he didn’t leave you anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] On the contrary, he left me all his debts.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Good afternoon, Grace.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Am I late? I think punctuality’s the most detestable of all the virtues.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>It’s a royal virtue, my dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>In that case, as a member of the middle classes, it’s not surprising
that I don’t practise it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>What can I get you, darling?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Is there anything nice to eat?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a grim smile.</i>] That is a matter of opinion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>There’s fried sole and eggs and bacon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I don’t think I’ll have anything. I’ll just have some tea and
toast.<a name="page_98" id="page_98"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>My dear, you’re not off your feed, are you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Grace has probably been stuffing herself with bread and butter in her
room. I have no patience with the new-fangled custom of giving people
tea when they wake up. I never give it to my guests.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>Then don’t ask me to come and stay with you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Delighted with the opportunity he has given her.</i>] It may surprise
you, but I have no intention of doing so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Cheerfully.</i>] There now. And I thought I’d made such an impression on
you, Mrs. Insoley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>That’s why I couldn’t risk asking you to stay with me. Perhaps at my age
I am safe from your blandishments, but Louisa is extremely susceptible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Hall.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mrs. Insoley, how can you! Why, Mr. Cobbett must be ten years
younger than I am.</p>

<p>[<i>Getting up from the table.</i>] I think you should remember, my dear
Grace, that suicide is not only very wicked, but very cowardly. I have
no patience with the sentimentalities of the present day. Our fathers
buried people who were sinful enough to destroy themselves at the
cross-roads with a stake in their insides. And it served them right.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Grace</span> <i>does not answer</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley</span>, <i>with a shrug of the

half-smothered, of impatient anger</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Oh, did you hear? They have the heart to chatter like that when that
unhappy girl is lying dead. They haven’t a word of pity. It seems to
mean nothing to them that she sacrificed herself. If she died, it was to
save her father, so that he shouldn’t be thrown out of work in his old
age. And they call her wicked and sinful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>But is that anything new to you? Haven’t you noticed that people always
rather resent the heroism<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a> of others? They don’t like the claim it makes
on <i>them</i>, and the easiest way to defend themselves is with a sneer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I might have saved her life if I’d chosen, but I hadn’t the courage.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Once I suspected what she was going to do, but she was too clever for
me. I so wanted to believe it was all right. I wanted her to go away
quietly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Trying to calm her.</i>] Lots of women have been in difficulties before,
and they haven’t killed themselves. There must have been some kink in
her nature. I suppose the instinct of life wasn’t so strong as it is
with most of us, and&mdash;and she would have committed suicide for almost
any reason.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>There was only one thing to say, and I didn’t say it. I couldn’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>You must utterly despise me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>No.... I feel awfully sorry for Claude.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Almost jealously.</i>] Claude’s your first thought always.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>He’s been the whole world to me since I was a girl of sixteen.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Is that why you never married?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>I suppose it is.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I never dreamt that anyone could care for Claude like that. I suppose
you see something in him that I’ve never seen.... He has a hundred
different ways of getting on my nerves.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>You see, I’m not irritated by the mannerisms that irritate you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reflectively.</i>] Real love accepts them, I suppose.<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>It wants them even because it’s something individual to cling to.... And
then it laughs at them a little, and the best love of all includes a
sense of humour.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>It’s made me feel so strange to know that you love him, Helen. It’s
given him something that he’s never had before.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>I don’t suppose any woman likes her husband less because she knows that

be plain.<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I love him as I never thought it was possible to love. I don’t know why
I love him. It’s come to me suddenly. I&mdash;oh, I can’t tell you what it
is. It’s like hunger in my soul. And I’m frightened.</p>

you and I&mdash;the first thing I felt was surprise because I found myself no
different. I thought when a woman had done that everything would seem
altered. But I felt just the same as before. It’s only now. It’s like
the stain of blood&mdash;don’t you remember&mdash;not all the perfumes of

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Cheerfully.</i>] Oh, no, my dear mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>When I asked Grace to invite Helen Vernon to stay here for a few days,
it was in the confident hope that you would make her a proposal of
marriage.<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I respect and esteem Miss Vernon, but I confess that no warmer feeling
has ever entered my bosom.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>It’s not necessary that warm feelings should enter a clergyman’s bosom,
Archibald. She’s of very good family indeed, and an heiress. Five
thousand acres and a house that’s only just been done up.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] If there only weren’t a wife to be taken along with
the property!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a twinkle in her eyes.</i>] It shouldn’t be necessary for me to tell
a person of your profession that none of the pleasures of this world can
be had without some drawback.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>What a pity it is you weren’t a man, mother. You would have made such a
bishop.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Are you trying to change the conversation, Archibald?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think it would be a bad idea.<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>Then I will only say one thing more. I am the meekest woman in the
world, and a lamb could lead me. But I should like to remind you that
the living of Kenyon-Fulton is not worth more than a hundred and seventy
a year, and if you can keep a curate and live like a gentleman it’s only
owing to my generosity.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I’m quite prepared to live on a hundred and seventy a year, mother. I
dare say it would have just as good an effect on my figure as matrimony.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather crossly.</i>] I don’t know what you’re talking about, Archibald.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I understood you to recommend marriage as a sort of heroic remedy for
corpulence.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>You have nothing against Helen, I presume?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I could have wished that fewer summers had passed over a
fringe which I shrewdly suspect to be artificial.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>On the contrary, I’m much too old a bird to be caught by chaff.</p>

<p>I’m sure we don’t want another flighty young thing in the family.</p>

<p>What’s the matter with her? She’s been going about with a face as long

<p>I thought you’d be at the inquest.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>No. There was no need for me to go. And Claude seemed to think he’d
rather I didn’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>What is this?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>The inquest on Peggy Gann.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Have you seen Claude?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>He looked in at the Rectory for five minutes. I’m afraid he’s awfully
worried.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I have no patience with Claude. He should have more self-respect than to
let such a thing worry him.<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>He’s afraid he may be asked some very unpleasant questions.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>You seem entirely to forget the relative positions of the parties
concerned. If Claude doesn’t want to answer an impertinent question,
it’s the easiest thing in the world for him to fly into a passion and
refuse. Who is the coroner?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>His name is Davies. He’s the local doctor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>You’re not going to suggest that the local doctor would dream of asking
a question unless he was quite sure Claude was prepared to answer it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Davies is an advanced Radical. I’m afraid he may take the opportunity to
have a fling at Claude.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Insoley.</span></p>

<p>I’m all at sea. In my day we wouldn’t have stood a doctor for five
minutes who was a Radical. We’d have made life unbearable for him until
he became a Conservative or left the district.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps it’s only your fancy. [<i>Turning round.</i>] Why are you telling me
now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid he’ll have rather a rough time at the inquest. I thought you
might say something to buck him up a little. A word or two from you
would mean so much.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a short pause.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I think it’s so strange that you should say all this to me now. It’s not
as if we’d ever been great friends, is it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Our best friends are always those who put us in a good conceit of
ourselves. I always think it’s a dreadful thing when a man loses his
nerve.... You can do so much for Claude if you choose.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I think you exaggerate the influence I have over him. After all, he’s
always taken care to keep me and his life strictly apart.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I think you should remember that if he made a<a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a> mistake it was an honest
one. He wouldn’t be human if he didn’t put his foot in it sometimes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>You speak as if I were perfection itself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>And then, if he was so determined not to break that particular rule of
the estate, it was partly for your sake, wasn’t it? Because he thought
it his duty to keep you from any possibility of contact with evil.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Did he tell you that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>No. It was not very difficult to guess.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I suppose not&mdash;for anyone who had eyes to see.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>You will do your best, Grace?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>What do you suggest I should do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

you should tell Claude&mdash;if you <a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a>can&mdash;that you’re fond of him, and that,
whatever happens, you always will be fond of him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid I’m not much in the way of parsons. My class means so much
more to me than my calling. I know it’s a mistake, and yet I can’t help
it. I’m bound down by conventions that I haven’t the will to escape
from. The day’s past of the family living, the perquisite of a younger
son, and I’m out of place here. I can’t feel that the position is mine
by right as my Uncle Robert felt before me, and I haven’t the enthusiasm
which might make me feel I’d earned it by my own efforts.<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’m so ashamed of myself. Because people didn’t carry their hearts on
their sleeves I thought they had no hearts at all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>For three years after I was ordained I was a curate at Wakefield. I was
worked so hard that I never had a moment to myself. I think those were
my happy days. And that’s what I ought to do now. I ought to exchange
all this for some living in a city, and do some real work before it’s
too late. But I haven’t the courage. And then I should do no good, for I
haven’t conviction. That’s why I have no influence in the parish. They
come to me for beef-tea and for coal-tickets, but when it’s real help
they want they go elsewhere. All I’m fit for is to hold a family living
and dine with the neighbouring gentry. You summed me up with the utmost
precision.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think so any more. I have an idea that perhaps one sees people
most truly when one sees them charitably.</p>

<p>You said you were in love with Claude.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Yes. That’s why I can’t bear the agony of it. I’m so unhappy. I’m so

do.</p>

already.... Oh, I hate myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I’m so bewildered. Why d’you tell <i>me</i>? I feel I ought to ask you all
sorts of questions, and I can’t bear to ask you anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think anything matters but that I’ve behaved odiously. Claude
was always very good to me, and I’ve deceived him. And every kindness,
every word of love he says to me is a reproach. And I love him with all
my soul, and there’s always the horror of what I’ve done between us. And
I can’t bear it any longer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I’m so helpless.</p>

<p>Then what shall I do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I can’t advise you. I haven’t got the experience. I know so little of
the world.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Helen Vernon. She found out. But I can’t go to her for advice. I can’t.
I can’t humiliate myself. And the remorse is just killing me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a deep, deep sigh.</i>] Oh, if you knew what a relief it would be!
For days I’ve been fighting with the temptation to make a clean breast
of it. I’ve been trying to keep it from me, trying not to think of it.
But it meets me at every turn. It haunts<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a> me. It’s like an obsession,
and it’s stronger than I am. It’s driving me&mdash;driving me to confess. I
know I shall have to do it; I can’t help myself. I shall go mad if I
don’t tell him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>For goodness’ sake, calm yourself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>If I’d told him before, when I was trying to persuade him to let Gann
stay, that girl wouldn’t have died. I hadn’t the courage. I wouldn’t
sacrifice myself. It was too much to ask me. And since then I’ve been
tortured by remorse. They say she had the suicidal instinct, and would
have killed herself for almost anything. But I seem to see her lying
there reproaching me. Reproaching me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Why don’t you go to Claude at once and get it over?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’m frightened. I’m just sick with fear. A dozen times I’ve been on the
point of it&mdash;just to have done with it, to get rid of the agony that
burnt my heart&mdash;and at the last moment I couldn’t. But it’s like being
on a high place and looking down and holding on to something so that you
shouldn’t throw yourself over. Sooner or later I shall have to do it.
It’s the only way to get back my self-respect. It’s the only chance I
have of living at all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I wish I could do more for you.<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>No one can do anything for me. Oh, it is cruel. And to come just now
when I love Claude! I didn’t love him at first. It came quite
suddenly&mdash;as if scales had been torn away from my eyes. And it wasn’t
till then that I saw the sin and the wickedness of it. Oh, it was so
much more than sin and wickedness. The filthiness. The only thing’s to
tell him and have done with it. You know he’ll divorce me, don’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>He loves you so much.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Even if it breaks his heart, he’ll force himself to divorce me. You know
what Claude is. He’ll think it’s his duty. He’ll do what he thinks he
ought to do even if it kills him. Oh, but if he’d only forgive me, I
would try to make amends. It’s so hard that I’ve only learnt how to be a
good wife now that I’m unfit to be his wife at all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>My dear, there are three good rules in life. The first is&mdash;never sin;
and that’s the most sensible. The second is&mdash;if you sin, never repent;
and that’s the bravest. But the third is&mdash;if you repent, never never
confess; and that’s the hardest of them all.<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think this is the time for flippancy, Helen.</p>

<p>Good heavens, I’m being as serious as I possibly can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>D’you mean to say you think Grace oughtn’t to say anything?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>I think it would be monstrous of her to say anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>If the sinner wants forgiveness, first of all he must confess his sin.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>You still look upon your God as a God of vengeance, who wants sacrifices
to appease Him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>That was said to a stiff-necked generation that wanted humbling. But no
one can want to humble us, surely. We’re so timid already. We’re so
unsure of ourselves. We’ve all got a morbid desire to unbosom ourselves.
The commonest ailment of the day<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a> is a vulgar feminine passion for
making scenes. Confession’s like a drug we fly to because we’ve lost the
last shadow of our self-reliance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Don’t let her move you, Grace. I beseech you, for your soul’s sake. Be
brave.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I know that it’s my only chance of happiness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Helen, how can you be so unkind?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>No one knows why we’ve been brought into the world, but it evidently
wasn’t for our happiness. Or if it was, the Being who put us here has
made a most outrageous mess of it. Put your happiness out of the
question.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very earnestly to</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span>.] If the sinner repents, let him confess his

<p>Part of my punishment is the feeling that except for this horrible
mistake we should both be so much happier than we were before.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

should step from the narrow path of virtue in order to become a virtuous
woman.<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>Helen, you can’t mean that.</p>

<p>It’s very often only repentance that makes men and women human.</p>

<p>Repentance is useless without sacrifice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I feel that. And the only sacrifice I can make is to lay bare my
soul before Claude and accept my punishment.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>And then, I think Claude should be given the chance of deciding for
himself. It’s not fair to leave him in ignorance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span>.] Don’t you know that Claude loves you, and trusts you, and
believes in you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>That is all my torment. I’m so unworthy. If I didn’t love him&mdash;if I
didn’t want him to love me so much&mdash;it wouldn’t be so dreadful.... I
can’t bear that there should be this secret between us. I know that he’s
not loving me, but some fancy of his own heart. And I’m jealous. I’m
jealous of the woman he loves who isn’t me. And I want him to love me as
I am, as I love him.<a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>Grace, don’t forget that I’ve loved him, too, hopelessly, without any
thought of a return. It gives me some claim, doesn’t it?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Archibald</span> <i>looks at her quickly, with surprise, but does not

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>If you destroy his belief in you he’ll have nothing left. He thinks he’s
strong, but he isn’t. He depends on a few simple principles, and some of
them are already giving way under his feet. He wants you now more than
ever. You can give him back his self-reliance. And you’re going to
humiliate him. Besides everything else, the misery and the grief, don’t
you see what a blow it’ll be to his vanity? I beseech you to have mercy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>You’re asking me to go on living the hateful lie. But I can’t breathe.
The air about me seems heavy with deceit. If Claude doesn’t love me for
what I am, what can his love be to me?<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>My dear, it’s not for ourselves that our friends love us, but for the
grace and the beauty that they’ve given us out of their own hearts. And
the only way we can show them our gratitude is by doing all we can to
preserve those precious illusions they have about us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I don’t want a love that’s based on illusion. At the back of my mind
there was the hope that if I told Claude, some day in the future he
might forgive me. And we could start fresh with mutual knowledge and
mutual confidence. But if I don’t tell him, we can never come together.
Even though we’re not separated for an hour, there’ll always be this
barrier between us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>Then let that be your punishment.</p>

<i>can’t</i> let him go on thinking I’m good and pure and chaste.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Archibald.</span></p>

<p>And how can good come out of a lie, Helen?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps it wouldn’t be a lie always. Don’t you<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a> remember the Happy
Hypocrite? Love can work many miracles.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sort of gasp.</i>] You mean&mdash;you think I might become really what
Claude thinks me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>You might try.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>D’you know that I should never have a moment’s peace?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>If you love Claude really, that mightn’t be too great a price to pay for
his happiness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Vehemently.</i>] Oh, it’s all very well for you to talk, but you don’t
know what this sense of shame is. It’s killing me. And the degradation
of being loved for what you’re not. And you want me never to escape from
it. Oh, you’re right. It would be a fiendish punishment.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>It’s the only return you can make for all the love that Claude has given
you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking up the thought.</i>] For his wonderful kindness,<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a> and all these
years of thought and loving tenderness.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>For a moment</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span> <i>stares in front of her as the words sink
in</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>Grace, it’s I who ask you now to be brave.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a great sigh.</i>] I seem to see the chance of a greater sacrifice
than anything I’d ever dreamt of. I wonder.... I believe there’s a
chance.... [<i>With a sudden start.</i>] Oh! listen.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She has heard</i> <span class="smcap">Claude</span> <i>come in. There is a sound of voices in the
hall.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>That’s settled it. It’s too late now to do anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Claude’s just come in. I heard him speaking to Moore. He’s been given
the letter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>D’you mean to say.... [<i>Some part of the facts dawns upon her and she
bursts out violently.</i>] Oh, it’s not that the human race are wicked that
I mind, or that they’re weak&mdash;you <i>can</i> give them backbone;<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a> but what I
can’t get over is that they are such blooming fools.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Will you leave me, both of you? Claude had better find me alone.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Vernon.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Archibald</span>, <i>after a glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span>.] Come.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>They go out.</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span> <i>is horribly frightened. She stands quite
still, pulling her handkerchief about.</i> <span class="smcap">Claude</span> <i>comes in</i>. <i>He has
a letter in his hand. He flings it on a table.</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span> <i>sees with a
start that it is unopened</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Forcing herself to seem natural.</i>] Is the inquest over?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sinking dejectedly into a chair.</i>] They brought in a verdict of
suicide while of unsound mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>That was what you expected, wasn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>You must be thankful it’s finished and done with.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an effort.</i>] The jury passed a vote of censure on me.<a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Claude!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Oh, if you’d only heard the questions they asked me! There were
reporters there, so it’ll be in the papers and you can read for
yourself. They made me appear a perfect brute.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure it wasn’t as bad as you fancy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>You see, I hadn’t a chance of defending myself. I wasn’t going to make
excuses to a parcel of Dissenting shopkeepers. It made me look as if I
hadn’t a leg to stand on.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>After all, what can it matter what a dozen yokels think of you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>And afterwards when I came out&mdash;they had the inquest in that big room
upstairs at the Insoley Arms&mdash;there was a crowd outside, people I’d
known all my life, I suppose they’d been taking the opportunity to have
a good soak, and they hissed me as I passed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Didn’t you say that you were going to abolish the rule?<a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Of course I’m going to abolish the rule. Hang it all, it’s caused
wretchedness enough.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I wish you’d had an opportunity of telling them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather shamefacedly.</i>] The coroner asked me what I was going to do
about it. I couldn’t knuckle under then with all those people round me.
I simply couldn’t, Grace. I was obliged to say that I meant to be master
in my own house, and I didn’t propose to let anyone dictate to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Putting her hand on his shoulder.</i>] I’m afraid you’ve been awfully
worried, old man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>It’s given me a bit of a knock to find out that they&mdash;they just hate me.
I was rather fond of the people on the estate, and I thought they were
fond of me. When they’ve been in trouble I’ve done every damned thing I
could to help them. When times have been bad I’ve not bothered much
about the rents, and we’ve never been rich. Hang it all, I’ve given them
all my time and my thoughts for years, and the only result is that they
can’t stick me. They haven’t got any mercy if I’ve made a mistake. They
give me no credit for good intentions.<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure you exaggerate, Claude. You fancy they feel more bitter than
they really do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Oh, if you’d only seen them! The pleasure they took in having a dig at
me! I could see the hatred on their faces. Oh, I expect Archibald is
right. Our time down here is over. The only fellow they want in the
country now is the Jew stockbroker with his pockets full of money.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>Darling, <i>I</i> know that you’ve always acted for the best. <i>I</i> know how
much you’ve done for the people on the estate. After all, it wasn’t for
their gratitude that you did it, was it? It was because it was your
duty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] Oh, Grace, I don’t know what I should do without you. You’ve
been so awfully good to me through the whole thing. I’m so grateful to
you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>What nonsense!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I was so afraid it would make a difference to you, but it hasn’t, has
it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking her head.</i>] No.<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>If I lost you, Grace, I couldn’t live. Without you&mdash;I can’t imagine life
without you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>How absurd you are, Claude.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I’m talking rot, aren’t I?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He notices the letter, which he had put on the table, and picks
it up.</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span> <i>catches her breath</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>Hulloa! I forgot to open this. Moore gave it me as I came in. [<i>With
surprise.</i>] It’s your hand-writing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quite naturally, holding out her hand.</i>] It’s nothing. I was afraid I
should have gone out by the time you came in, and I wanted to remind you
about the herbaceous border. It’s only a note.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Giving her the letter.</i>] Are you going out?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>I was going to motor to Wells with Helen Vernon.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>As she speaks she tears the letter into little bits.</i></p></div>

<p><a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a></p>

<p>Don’t leave me to-day, Grace. I want you so awfully badly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

you want me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Claude.</span></p>

<p>I always want you, Grace. You’re so much to me.... After all, nothing
can really matter to me so long as I have you. It’s such a comfort to
think that I can trust you. And you’ll never round on me. I’m awfully
grateful for you, Grace.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He buries his face in her lap, kissing her hands.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Grace.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a trembling voice.</i>] I can never be such a wife to you as you
deserve, Claude. But I can try. If you can believe in me always, Claude,
perhaps in time I can become what you believe me. [<i>He makes a
movement.</i>] No, don’t look at me. I want you to know that I love you
with all my heart, I love you with my body, and I love you with my soul.
I want to forget myself and think only of you. What does my happiness
matter so long as I can make you happy?</p>

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
